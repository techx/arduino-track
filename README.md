## Notes

Wiring diagrams made using [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/).

In this course we don't expect students to write much of their own code. We
explain just enough syntax for students to understand the code we provide.
Later, we provide working code for students to modify (e.g. if/else
statements, constants, parameters).

We provide bonus exercises for students more familiar with coding at the
bottom of each lesson.

Projects build upon each other for the first three workshops so students
don't have to rewire anything. We emphasize interactive projects like games.

We try to minimize dead time / tedious tasks by providing all code and
diagrams on this website.
