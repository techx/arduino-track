# Notes

Wiring diagrams using [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/home/)

* less intimidating than a schematic; clearer than a picture

## from Rinik

* Should not expect students to write code
  * Explain enough syntax so students can understand the code we provide
  * Provide working code for students to modify and change functionality
    * e.g. changing control if/else statements
    * or change constants/parameters in functions
  * Provide options for students familiar with coding
    * coding-based open-ended project
    * optional tasks (?)
* Give students labels so they can grab the same kit at the hackathon

## from meeting w/ Joe

* Make sure to have extra tasks/projects ready!
* Build projects upon each other for first 3 hours
  * donâ€™t rewire everything
* Interactive projects are best (e.g. games / anything with IO)
* Minimize dead time / tedious tasks
  * static website for copying code (w/ explanation)
  * lecture notes w/ diagrams + code
  * minimize potential troubleshooting
