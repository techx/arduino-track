It's the final workshop! You're probably tired out from a long day of
learning, so for this workshop you have the whole hour to work on any project
you want.

The [Arduino reference][arduino-ref] documents the Arduino language's
functions, variables, and structure.

Donâ€™t be afraid to talk to mentors and each other ðŸ˜Š

## Guided project: Reaction Speed Game

The Reaction Speed Game uses 5 LEDs and a button -- can you react fast enough
to stop the light in the right spot? You can build off this starter project
and add new features.

The code is [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/static/files/reaction_game.ino).

Some possible add-ons:

- Display the final score on the LCD
- Incorporate a buzzer for audio feedback

## Other guided projects

Play around with combining parts in creative ways! Some new examples and
examples we mentioned before:

- Take on any of the bonus exercises mentioned at the end of each lesson.
- Build upon the [LCD and joystick example]({{ site.baseurl
  }}/static/files/lcd_control.ino) we made to make a game.
- Music visualizer (microphone, LEDs)
- Radar system [[video][radar]]-- more coding than wiring/hardware
- Theremin (buzzer, photoresistor)
- Bop-it game (buttons, potentiometer, tilt switch, etc.)
- Burglar alarm (ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, LEDs)

If you'd like some more guidance, the Elegoo Uno Super Starter Kit
[guidebook][elegoo-guide] and [starter code][elegoo-code] has lots of project
ideas.

## Once you're done

Take pictures and videos of your creation, then go ahead and **disassemble it
and return the parts to the box**.

If youâ€™re coming to the hackathon, weâ€™ll see you tomorrow!
