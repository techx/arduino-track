title: Blinking LEDs (digital output)

Let's put down the Arduino board for the moment and turn our attention to the
Arduino IDE. The Arduino IDE ([integrated development environment][ide]) is
where we write code and upload it to the board. Just like you may write
papers in Microsoft Word, you can write Arduino programs in the Arduino IDE.

Since you're working in partners, each of you can write code individually and
take turns uploading it to the board.

Let's write a basic program to blink the on-board LED on and off.

## Blank sketch

You'll notice that the Arduino IDE starts up with a blank file like this.

```cpp
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

As it says in the comment, the `setup` function is run once as soon as the
program starts up. Then, the `loop` function runs over and over.

## Setting up the pin

Let's add one line in to `setup`.

```cpp
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

}
```

As you may recall from our [board overview](/lectures/board/), "pins" are the
labeled black holes on the edges of the board. They allow the board to
reference external devices. In this case, pin 13 _also_ refers to the board's
internal LED.

The `pinMode` function sets the mode of the specified pin. Here, we set pin
13 to `OUTPUT` mode. Each pin is explicitly for input or output, and we
choose output here to control the LED.

## Writing to the pin

Next, let's add code in `loop` to actually send some output.

```cpp
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
  digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```

The `digitalWrite` function writes some value to a pin. A digital value can
either be `HIGH` or `LOW` (on or off, 1 or 0, etc.), so what this first line
means is we send a `HIGH` voltage to pin 13, turning the LED on.

Next, we call `delay`. `delay` pauses the execution of the program for some
number of milliseconds (ms). 1000ms is one second, so we're delaying
execution for one second. This keeps the LED on for one second.

The next two lines turn the LED off, then delay another second. Then the loop
will repeat again. This makes the LED blink!

## Uploading code

Check before you upload that you have these five lines in your sketch. If you
want to double check, you can also find this code under
`File > Examples > 01.Basics > Blink` in the Arduino IDE.

Now it's time to upload! Use the USB to microUSB cable in your kit to plug
your Arduino into your laptop. Go to `Tools > Port` in the Arduino IDE to
confirm that the IDE has recognized the device. It might call it `COM5` or
`USB_to_UART` or something like that. Also check that under `Tools > Board`
the board `Arduino Uno` is selected.

Finally, click the "Upload" button in the top left corner of the window to
upload your code!

Hopefully your blink will look something like this! If you've got this
working, you can play with changing the delay amount from 1000ms to something
else.

## Blink off-board LED

Now that we've got the onboard LED blinking, let's try it with an LED we wire
up ourselves. Open up your kit and pull out the breadboard.

If you were to rip off the back of a breadboard (DON'T DO THIS, though!), you
would see how the rows and columns are connected.

Anything connected by metal in this photo is connected within the breadboard.
We'll use this breadboard to connect the LED to the Arduino.

    * 2 wires (any color!)
  * UNPLUG before wiring (makes sure you donâ€™t damage anything)
  * Assemble materials
    * Long leg goes to resistor
    * Resistor goes to pin 13
    * Short leg goes to GND
* Change pin in code & wiring and observe effect
