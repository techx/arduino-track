**Source code:** [1.6_rgb_led/1.6_rgb_led.ino](1.6_rgb_led/1.6_rgb_led.ino)

* [DOC CAM] show RGB LED
  * Basically 3 LEDs in one package: red, green, and blue
  * They share a common pin that goes to GND, so 4 total
  * Connect each one to an individual output and you can mix any color you want by using **analogWrite** on each pin
  * Show wiring - donâ€™t unwire regular LED!
* [IDE]
  * Show example of `analogWrite` to each channel
  * Play with different values to see what colors you can create!
  * Advanced: use delays and/or variables/loops to change colors over time
* _[SLIDE 16] optional RGB LED wiring diagram_
